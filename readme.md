\# Student Performance Classification:



This project focuses on predicting whether a student will \*\*pass or fail\*\* based on academic and personal factors using 'random forest' techniques.



The goal of this project is to understand how different features such as study hours, attendance, previous grades, extracurricular participation, and parental education level influence student performance.



## Model Performance Note

This project was implemented as a beginner-level machine learning practice project.
After correcting data leakage by using a proper train–test split, the model achieved
an accuracy of approximately 50%.

This result highlights an important machine learning concept:
model performance depends heavily on feature relevance and data quality.
The project successfully demonstrates the complete ML pipeline rather than
optimizing for high accuracy.


## Conclusion:



This project shows how machine learning can be effectively applied to predict student performance.  

It can be further extended by adding more features, testing different algorithms, or deploying the model.
