\# Student Performance Classification:



This project focuses on predicting whether a student will \*\*pass or fail\*\* based on academic and personal factors using \*\*Machine Learning\*\* techniques.



The goal of this project is to understand how different features such as study hours, attendance, previous grades, extracurricular participation, and parental education level influence student performance.

\## Dataset Description:



The dataset contains academic and personal details of students.

It includes study hours, attendance rate, and previous grades.

Information about extracurricular participation is also provided.

Parental education level is used as a background factor.

The target variable indicates whether a student passed or failed.

\## Model Evaluation:



The model was evaluated using:



\- Accuracy Score

\- Confusion Matrix



\*\*Results:\*\*

\- Accuracy achieved: \*\*~99.97%\*\*

\- Very low misclassification rate
